# Quickstart

Spicy is a Linux frontend/backend fork of Pi. It also retains Pi's terminal interface. To use it, you need access to a model through a supported provider: a subscription, an API key, or a local model.

## 1. Set up Spicy

With Node.js 22.19 or newer, run from the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5174 for the frontend. Upstream Pi installers do not install Spicy. The `pi update` command updates extension packages and refreshes models, not Spicy itself.

## 2. Use the terminal interface

To use the TUI instead, build from the repository root:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then start the built CLI in the folder you want it to work with:

```bash
cd /path/to/folder
node /path/to/spicy/packages/coding-agent/dist/cli.js
```

The examples below use `pi` as shorthand for that CLI invocation.

The working folder helps Pi discover relevant files, instructions, and configuration. Pi also uses it to group saved sessions.

The interface shows your conversation, an editor for prompts and commands, and a footer with the current folder, model, and session status. See [Use Pi in the terminal](usage.md) to learn how to add files, run commands, direct ongoing work, and manage results.

## 3. Choose a model

A **model** generates Pi's responses. A **provider** is the service or account Pi uses to access that model.

In Pi, run:

```text
/login
```

Choose a provider, then follow the prompts to use a subscription or store an API key. Run `/model` afterward if you want to select a different available model.

See [Choose a model and provider](models.md) for supported providers, environment-variable authentication, local models, and custom endpoints.

## 4. Give Pi a task

Pi shows each file read, search, command, and edit it performs. It does not ask before every tool call.

Enter a task that matches your work, for example:

```text
Summarize @meeting-notes.md and save the action items to action-items.md.
```

```text
Explain how this repository is structured and how to run its checks.
```

```text
Compare @previous.csv with @current.csv and summarize the important changes.
```

Type `@` in the editor to search for a file instead of entering its full path. When Pi finishes, review its response and any changed files. Use version control or backups for important work. For untrusted or unattended work, use a container or another sandbox. See [Security](security.md).

## Continue later

Pi saves sessions automatically. Exit Pi, then resume the most recent session for the same working folder with:

```bash
pi --continue
```

Use `/resume` to choose another saved session. See [Continue or branch a session](sessions.md) for session naming, branching, and compaction.

## Next steps

- [Use Pi interactively](usage.md) to learn input, commands, shortcuts, and queued messages.
- [Add instructions](configuration.md#context-files) that Pi should follow whenever it works in a folder.
- [Choose a model and provider](models.md).

### Choose how to customize Pi

Start with the least powerful mechanism that meets your need:

| Need | Start with |
|---|---|
| Give Pi persistent instructions for a folder | [`AGENTS.md`](configuration.md#context-files) |
| Reuse a prompt from the `/` menu | [Prompt template](prompt-templates.md) |
| Add task-specific instructions and supporting files | [Skill](skills.md) |
| Add executable tools, commands, or event handlers | [Extension](extensions.md) |
| Build a custom terminal component | [Terminal UI](tui.md) |
| Connect an unsupported model service | [Custom provider](custom-provider.md) |
| Install or distribute several resources | [Pi package](packages.md) |

## Remove Spicy

Stop the development server and remove the repository checkout when no longer needed. Configuration, credentials, sessions, and installed Pi packages in `~/.pi/agent/` remain separate; removing the checkout does not delete them.
